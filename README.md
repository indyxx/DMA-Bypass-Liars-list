On November 13, 2024 (GMT+8), I purchased their custom service "PRO service" for $140 from the Discord channel associated with JOKOSAHS (he was called peterlews at the time). My only request was to get a relatively stable firmware (it seems he’s even worse than others, who at least send you a usable firmware).

The process starts by joining his Discord community (he frequently changes its name, but it’s always related to DMA firmware). If you don’t create a ticket within a certain time to tell him you want to join VIP, he might delete you in advance. The service is advertised to support multiple games, but he kept delaying it with various excuses (weekend breaks, issues with my device, incompatible firmware, etc.). After purchasing the equipment he required, I was banned.

Last night, he deleted me and banned me from his community channel, and now I can’t private message him. I’ve already purchased the equipment he demanded. What should I do? I’d like to ask for everyone’s advice.

Before this issue is resolved properly, I will continue to update and collect information about him.

Additional information:
I discovered that he is promoting a product called "DMAOL," claiming that it can generate firmware online as a selling point. I can’t confirm its authenticity, but based on my experience, I firmly believe it’s fake.

GMT+8时间2024年11月13日我从 https://github.com/JOKOSAHS 的Discord频道(他当时叫peterlews)购买了他们的定制服务PRO service花费140$，我的诉求只是想得到一个相对稳定的固件(看来他还不如那些人，起码会发给我个能用的固件)。

流程是先加入他的Discord社区(他会随时更新名称，但是都是与DMA固件相关的)，如果你不在一定时间内创建工单告诉他你要加入vip他可能会提前删除你，功能是可以支持多种游戏，中间一直以各种理由拖延(周末休息，你的设备不行，你的固件不支持等,并且我购买了他要求的设备后就被ban了)，直到昨天晚上他删除了我并将我从他的社区频道封禁。

并且我也无法私聊他们，他要求我购买的设备我也已经购买，我现在应该怎么做呢想问问大家。在这件事没有得到一个妥善的解决方案之前我会一直更新与收集他的信息。

补充一下，我发现他在以一个叫DMAOL的产品，以可以在线生成固件为噱头进行，我目前无法确定真伪，但是根据我的遭遇，我坚信他是假的。
